# LeetCode Notes Recommendations

We recommend keeping separate notes for different purposes. Otherwise, things can get piled up and messy quickly.

For example, maintain:
- One note file for algorithms and problem-solving patterns—**use this especially when you're learning new concepts**
- One for handy programming language syntax—**use this when you encounter syntax or libraries you don't know and there are no easy workarounds**
- One for boilerplate code you can use directly, such as the basic implementation of binary search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and Longest Common Subsequence—**use this when you have repetitive code patterns you can't implement easily from memory**

There are sample notes under the `sample_notes` directory for reference. The contents in the sample notes are AI-generated for the sole purpose of demonstrating recommended formats.


# CODE Method

The section above contains recommendations, not mandates. However, you need to write notes that are organized and easily retrievable so that your note-taking efforts don't go to waste. For this, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the CODE method and implementing it in your note-taking system.

**CODE** stands for:
- **C**apture: Keep what resonates and will be useful in the future
- **O**rganize: Save for actionability
- **D**istill: Find the essence
- **E**xpress: Show your work

When applying CODE to LeetCode practice:

**Capture** problems that genuinely teach you something new or challenge your understanding, not every problem you solve. Very  repetitive concepts will be mastered through practice, but if you find **something that you will reference frequently** but struggle  to remember, or **something that don't appear frequently, but you will get stuck once it shows up**, include them in your notes. When you learn something new, also include it in your notes.

**Organize** your notes based on actionability—group problems by current skill gaps you're addressing or interview preparation goals rather than just by topic. Also, always keep your notes very accessible.

**Distill** each solution through progressive summarization: highlight key insights, bold the most important patterns, and surface the core algorithm that makes each solution work.

**Express** your understanding by explaining solutions in your own words, teaching others, or writing up your insights. This completes the learning cycle and makes your second brain truly valuable.
