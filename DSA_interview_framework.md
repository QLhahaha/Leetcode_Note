# A framework for solving a DSA problem in the interview (or in the video)

## Time limit: 
The rule of thumb is 25 minutes for a medium problem. However, based on the interviewer, the situation may vary.

## Steps: 
### 1. Clarify the problem (2-3 min)
Restate the problem, including edge cases and constraints if given; ask if not given.
### 2. Example walkthrough (2-3 min)
Demonstrate that you understand the problem during this step; create your own examples when the given ones aren't sufficient (but go over the given ones quickly first)
### 3. Approach discussion (3-5 min)
Start with brute force, discuss alternatives and complexity(not always required). If the solution is quite obvious, you can skip the brute force, but always fall back to brute force if you get stuck.
### 4. Code (10-15 min)
Implement while explaining; handle edge cases
### 5. Test & debug (3-5 min)
Walk through examples, fix bugs

## Tips: 
Always communicate with interviewers to get buy-in, the key is not only to solve the problem, but also to demonstrate your effective commutation skills and make the interviewers want to work with you.

# Feedbacks on previous recorded videos:
Based on the framework above, let’s go over your solution videos.

## LC 399, Evaluate division: 
### 1. Clarify the problem (2-3 min)
Problems restated, but not very clear
### 2. Example walkthrough (2-3 min)
This part is okay.
### 3. Approach discussion (3-5 min)
Not very clear, you need to lay out the key steps before you dive into coding.
For example, for this question, key steps are:
* A. Propose the algorithm you’re going to use first, like BFS or DFS, before you going over more detailed steps.
* B. Explain that you need to build a graph based on the given arrays by creating an adjacency list
* C. Explain how you can know whether an equation is computable through BFS or DFS (i.e. by using DFS, if we see node A can reach node C, we know A/C can be computed)
### 4. Code (10-15 min)
You don’t need to be very specific to each line of code, but you need to map each section with your previous stated approach, and explain things when you feel necessary.
### 5. Test & debug (3-5 min)
This part is okay.

## LC 102 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal 
This video is better, but you need to spend more time clarifying the problem and go over examples. 
Even if the problem is easy for you, make sure you  still follow the framework to demonstrate your effective communication skills.

Also, Python is easier to code up during the interviews (fewer lines of code and more hassle free). You might consider switching to Python even if right now you’re more familiar with C++.
